## Document Details
* **Type**: Undergraduate Research Thesis (CURO)
* **Length**: 36 Pages

## Executive Summary
This thesis proposes a novel theoretical framework to analyze the emergence of "grey zone" security cooperation between Israel and Arab states. By synthesizing neoclassical realism and constructivism, the paper argues that states like Saudi Arabia and the UAE utilize covert digital tools such as Pegasus spyware and AI-driven intelligence systems, to bypass domestic normative constraints while balancing against shared threats like Iran.

## Key Themes
* **Covert Alliances**: Exploration of how military software serves as a "service" that allows for robust security linkage without formal diplomatic ties.
* **Technological Force Multipliers**: The role of Israeli human capital in developing AI systems (e.g., Lavender and Gospel) used to enhance intelligence and targeting.
* **Normative Cycles**: Analysis of how domestic religious and national identity influences state behavior in international security.
